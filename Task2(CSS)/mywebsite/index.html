        <h1> This is a static positioned div</h1>
        <p>Static Positioning: The default positioning for elements on a page. It means the element will flow in the
            document from top to bottom and left to right.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="position: relative; top: 20px; left: 30px;">
        <h1> This is a relatively positioned div</h1>
        <p>Relative Positioning: An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. This
            can be used to move an element left, right, up, or down, while still leaving a blank space where it would
            normally have been located.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="position: relative;">
        <div style="position: absolute; top: 20px; left: 30px;">
            <h1>This is an absolutely positioned div</h1>
            <p>Absolute Positioning: An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to its nearest
                positioned ancestor (if any), otherwise, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block. This
                can be used to place an element in a specific location on the page, regardless of other elements around
                it.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div style="position: fixed;bottom:150px;left: 30px;">
       <h1> This is a fixed positioned div</h1>
        <p>Fixed Positioning: An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.</p>
    </div>
